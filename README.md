# My Narrative

A quick and easy to use Journal App that focusses on privacy and simplicity.

## Features

+ Your data never leaves your device
+ Create your own journal template
+ Export or back up your data
+ Support for light/dark themes
+ No tracking or analytics - if you care to, please provide feedback via github issue.

## Why?

My 2021 new years resolution was to start journalling. I started with a simple template and as a way to record the kinds of things I was doing with my time.

As I continue to journal this app will probably change slightly, some of the features I want to get around to adding are..

+ **Search** - search through all previous journal entries
+ **Encryption** - encrypt entries stored locally
+ **Cloud Backup** - background sync to cloud (encrypted locally)
